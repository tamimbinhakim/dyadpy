# @dyadpy/ts

> The tiny TypeScript runtime imported by Dyadpy-generated clients.

```bash
pnpm add @dyadpy/ts@alpha   # alpha channel — drop `@alpha` once v0.1.0 ships
```

You shouldn't have to think about this package much. The
[`dyadpy`](https://pypi.org/project/dyadpy/) Python CLI writes a generated
`client/` directory into your frontend that imports from `@dyadpy/ts`. That's it.

> **Why `@dyadpy/ts` and not `@dyadpy/react`?**
> Because this package is intentionally framework-agnostic. It's the
> tiny TypeScript runtime that the generated client imports
> regardless of where it ends up — Next.js, Vite + React, SvelteKit,
> SolidStart, Astro, plain HTML, a Node script. The name `@dyadpy/ts`
> reflects the language (TypeScript), not a framework. Framework-specific
> bindings live in their own packages:

Hard rules I've held this package to:

- **Zero runtime dependencies.** Anything we need (SSE parsing, nested
  dispatch) ships inline.
- **Tree-shakable.** ESM-first, side-effect-free.
- **Tiny.** Target is under ~3 KB min+gz. We check it in CI.

| `createLazyClient<ApiRoutes>({ routeMeta, loadRoute, baseUrl, headers, fetch })` | Returns the nested object your generated `api.*` calls dispatch through while loading full route descriptors on demand. |
| `forwardHeaders(request)`                                                        | Copies cookies/auth/tracing headers into SSR calls.                                                                     |

| `unwrapResult(value)`                                                            | Unwrap a `Result<T, E>` envelope onto `data` / `throw error`. Used by the binding packages.                             |

If you find yourself reaching for something else, that's probably a bug
in the codegen — open an
[issue](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/dyadpy/issues).
