toolchain migrations, and other things that don't belong to a single package.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial repository scaffold.
- Governance: the v1.0 stability commitments are written down rather
  than just promised. Four documents cover the corners that matter —
  [`docs/semver.md`](./docs/semver.md) (public API + deprecation cycle),
  [`docs/ir-stability.md`](./docs/ir-stability.md) (wire format / IR
  invariants), [`docs/lts.md`](./docs/lts.md) (support windows + EOL),
  and the codegen-output-is-part-of-the-surface clause that's now part
  of the README.
